# Coindoro

Welcome to the currency-based time tracking app! This lets you earn coins that you can spend on breaks!

**Focus Time**: This is time for you to work! Lock in so you can earn coins!
**Free Time**: This is time you can "purchase" by spending coins. Play games, watch videos, or even code! The choice is yours!

*This project was made for the Siege challenge by HackClub. Thank you!*
